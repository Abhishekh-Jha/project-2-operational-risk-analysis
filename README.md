Operational Risk & Returns Analysis – Python + Excel Project
A hybrid business analysis project designed to identify return patterns, refund losses, and logistics delays using simulated e-commerce data. The project combines Python-driven data cleaning with Excel-based dashboards to deliver sharp business insights.

 Project Goal
To evaluate refund-heavy categories and regions, diagnose root causes behind operational inefficiencies, and provide actionable recommendations for improving return rates and delivery performance.

 Tools & Skills Used
•	Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – for data cleaning, metric calculation, visual plots
•	Excel– for pivot analysis, dashboards, and visual storytelling
•	GitHub– for professional documentation
•	Business Thinking – category insights, refund losses, risk flagging

 Key Metrics & Business Questions
•	Return % by Product Category  
•	Refund Loss by Region  
•	Avg Delivery Delay by Region  
•	Top Return Reasons  
•	Where are high-risk zones?  
•	What’s causing cancellation and delays?

Root Cause Analysis & Insights:
Insight --  Root cause --	Suggested fix
High returns in  Home & Kitchen	-- Fragile/delicate items, poor images --	Improve product visuals & packaging
Max refund loss in North	-- High return volume --	Audit sellers & category quality
Most returns due to Cancellation by Buyer	-- Delay anxiety, unclear ETA	-- Real-time alerts & faster dispatch
Longest delivery delay in South & North --	Warehouse lag, courier mismatch	-- Reroute orders, partner regionally
