Operational Risk & Returns Analysis – Python + Excel Project
This is a business analysis project built using Python and Excel to explore return trends, refund losses, and delivery delays in a simulated e-commerce dataset. The goal is to identify operational inefficiencies and present data-driven insights through KPIs and dashboards.

Objective
To analyze category-wise and region-wise business risks in terms of:
-	Return percentage
-	Refund amount loss
-	Average delivery delay
-	Return reason distribution
  
 Tools & Technologies Used
•	Python – Pandas, Matplotlib (via Google Colab)
•	Excel – Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboarding
•	GitHub*– Project documentation & file hosting
•	Canva– 1-page infographic summary

 Business Insights Answered
-	Which product categories have the highest return rate?
-	Which regions are most delayed in delivery?
-	Where is refund loss the highest?
-	Why are customers returning products (return reasons)?
  
 Key Metrics Calculated
-	Total Delay = Delivery Time – Dispatch Time
-	Refund % = Refund / Price × 100
-	High Risk Zones = Delay Risk > 70%
-	Return % by Category
-	Refund Loss by Region
  
 Visuals Included
- Bar Chart – Return % by Category  
- Pie Chart – Return Reasons  
- Bar Chart – Refund Loss by Region
